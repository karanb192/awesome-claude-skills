# awesome-claude-skills: The Most Comprehensive Claude Skills List (50+ Skills)

I've been frustrated by incomplete and outdated skill lists, so I built the definitive collection.

**What makes this different:**
- 50+ skills (most comprehensive list available)
- Verification badges for community-tested skills
- 11 organized categories
- Automated link checking
- Easy contribution process

**Featured categories:**
- Document Processing (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Testing & Quality (TDD, E2E, Playwright)
- Debugging (Systematic debugging, Root cause analysis)
- Workflow (Git worktrees, Code review, Planning)
- Development (MCP builder, Artifacts, API design)
- And 6 more...

**Why I built this:**
The existing lists were either too small (15-32 skills) or poorly organized. We needed a community-driven, verified, actively maintained list.

**Link:** [Insert GitHub URL]

Would love your feedback and contributions! What skills are you using?
