## Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Be concise** - Descriptions should be under 150 characters
- **Be specific** - Avoid vague terms like "helps with" or "improves"
- **Use active voice** - "Implements TDD workflow" not "TDD workflow is implemented"
- **Focus on outcomes** - What does the user achieve, not just what the skill does

### Formatting

- **Skill names** - Use kebab-case: `test-driven-development`, not `Test Driven Development`
- **Bold important info** - Use **bold** for field labels like `**Source:**`
- **Links** - Always link to source repositories
- **Emojis** - Use category emojis consistently: üß™ üêõ ü§ù ‚öôÔ∏è üîí üìö üéØ

### Star Rating Guidelines

Rate skills honestly based on utility and quality:

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Essential, game-changing, widely used (100+ GitHub stars, proven in production)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Very useful, high quality, well-maintained (50+ stars, good documentation)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Solid, useful for specific cases (working, maintained, clear purpose)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Niche use case, needs improvement (limited use, sparse docs)
- ‚≠ê - Experimental, early stage (beta, incomplete, proof-of-concept)

**When in doubt:** Start with ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê and adjust based on adoption and quality.
