## Quick Start

**Get your first skill running in 30 seconds:**

```bash
# 1. Install obra's superpowers collection (20+ battle-tested skills)
git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers ~/.claude/skills/superpowers

# 2. Try test-driven-development skill
# In Claude Code, just say: "Let's use TDD to build a user authentication system"
# Claude will automatically load the TDD skill and guide you through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR!
```

**That's it!** Skills load automatically when relevant. No configuration needed.

## What are Skills?

**Agent Skills** are modular capabilities that extend Claude Code's functionality through organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources. Each skill teaches Claude how to perform specialized tasks in a repeatable, standardized way.

**Key benefits:**
- **Efficient:** Skills use only 30-50 tokens until loaded
- **Portable:** Works across Claude Code CLI, Claude.ai, and API
- **Composable:** Stack multiple skills together
- **Context-aware:** Claude automatically identifies relevant skills

Skills are available on Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans with code execution enabled.

## Featured Skills

# Windows (PowerShell)
mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills
git clone https://github.com/owner/skill-name $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\skill-name
```

**Pro tip:** Clone entire skill collections like [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) to get 20+ skills at once!

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Create a folder in `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and instructions
3. (Optional) Include supporting scripts and resources

**Verify installation:**
```bash
# Check if skill is loaded
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# Skills load automatically - just start using Claude Code!
```

## Skills vs MCP vs System Prompts

Confused about when to use Skills vs other Claude customization methods? Here's the breakdown:

| Feature | Skills | MCP Servers | System Prompts |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Task-specific workflows | External tool integration | General behavior modification |
| **Setup** | Git clone to `~/.claude/skills/` | Install & configure MCP server | Edit `CLAUDE.md` in project |
| **Activation** | Automatic (context-aware) | Explicit tool calls | Always active |
| **Best For** | TDD, debugging, git workflows | APIs, databases, file systems | Project conventions, style guides |
| **Portability** | Cross-platform (CLI, web, API) | Platform-dependent | Project-specific |
| **Token Cost** | 30-50 until loaded | Per-call | Always consuming tokens |
| **Examples** | `test-driven-development` | Weather API, GitHub integration | "Use TypeScript strict mode" |

**When to use what:**
- ‚úÖ **Skills** ‚Üí Repeatable workflows (TDD, debugging, code review)
- ‚úÖ **MCP** ‚Üí External data/tools (APIs, search, databases)
- ‚úÖ **System Prompts** ‚Üí Project-specific rules and conventions

## FAQ

### How do I know if a skill is working?

Skills load automatically when Claude detects they're relevant. You'll see Claude using skill-specific patterns (like RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for TDD). To check installed skills:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Can I use multiple skills at once?

Yes! Skills are composable. Claude automatically loads and coordinates multiple skills as needed. For example, you might use `test-driven-development` + `systematic-debugging` + `using-git-worktrees` simultaneously.

### Do skills work on all platforms?

Yes! Skills use the same format across Claude Code CLI, Claude.ai, and the Claude API. Install once, use everywhere.

### How do I update skills?

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/skill-name
git pull origin main
```

### Can I create my own skills?

Absolutely! Check out the [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) skill and our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for best practices.

### Do skills consume tokens?

Minimal! Each skill uses only 30-50 tokens until Claude loads it. Once loaded, only relevant portions are used.

### What's the difference between skills and MCP servers?

See the [comparison table](#skills-vs-mcp-vs-system-prompts) above. TL;DR: Skills for workflows, MCP for external tools.

### Where can I find more skills?

- [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) - 20+ battle-tested skills
- [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - Official Anthropic skills
- [claudeskills.info](https://claudeskills.info/) - Searchable directory
- This list! Browse the categories above

### Can I share my skills?

Yes! Submit a PR to this repo or publish your own repository. Use the [sharing-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skill for guidance.

### Are there any security concerns?

Skills can execute code, so only install from trusted sources. Review the skill's `SKILL.md` and any scripts before installing. See [Security Best Practices](#security-best-practices) in Contributing.
