## What are Skills?

**Agent Skills** are modular capabilities that extend Claude Code's functionality through organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources. Each skill teaches Claude how to perform specialized tasks in a repeatable, standardized way.

**Key benefits:**
- **Efficient:** Skills use only 30-50 tokens until loaded
- **Portable:** Works across Claude Code CLI, Claude.ai, and API
- **Composable:** Stack multiple skills together
- **Context-aware:** Claude automatically identifies relevant skills

Skills are available on Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans with code execution enabled.
